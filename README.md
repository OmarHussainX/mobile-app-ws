#  A Java-based RESTful Web Service app

Having built full-stack apps using Node+Express and python+Flask, this
project explores the creation of a RESTful Web Service in Java [(Maven build)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-maven-plugin/) - with a complete model, view and controller layer (including relational database integration) - using:

* [Spring Boot](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-parent)
* [Spring Boot Web Starter](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-web)
<br/>Starter for building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Tomcat as the default embedded container
* [Spring Boot Data JPA Starter](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-data-jpa)
<br/>Starter for using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
* [MySQL Connector/J](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java)
<br/>JDBC Type 4 driver for MySQL
* [Spring Boot Test Starter](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-test)
<br/>Starter for testing Spring Boot applications with libraries including JUnit, Hamcrest and Mockito
